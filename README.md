# Rock-paper-Scissor
Rock-Paper-Scissors game, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offers an interactive and visually appealing experience.

The HTML structure provides the basic layout, while CSS enhances the design with stylish buttons and animations. JavaScript handles the game logic, allowing users to select their choice and see the computer's random selection. The game then determines the winner based on the classic rules and displays the result dynamically on the webpage. This project showcases your skills in front-end development and your ability to create engaging web applications.
